I work on honest, leakage-safe quantitative research and focus on understanding why trading strategies fail once realistic constraints, validation rigor, and risk asymmetries are applied.

My work sits at the intersection of:

statistical learning,

market microstructure constraints,

and real-world trading economics.

I am particularly interested in path-dependent payoffs, robustness of alpha, and failure modes of seemingly profitable strategies.

🔍 Research Philosophy

Most trading signals do not fail because of bad math —
they fail because of poor validation, hidden leakage, and unrealistic assumptions.

My work focuses on:

eliminating look-ahead and label leakage,

stress-testing signals beyond peak Sharpe,

modeling real trading constraints (stop-outs, resets, costs, payout rules),

and understanding how and where performance degrades.

I value statistical integrity over optimization.

📌 Selected Projects
🧪 Monte Carlo Simulation of Prop Firm Trader Economics

Path-dependent PnL under stop-outs, resets, payout rules, and profit splits

Models trader wealth, not just strategy returns

Captures asymmetric downside from stop-out rules

Demonstrates how positive expectancy strategies can still lead to negative trader outcomes

Focus on contract structure, not alpha generation

Key insight:

Expected strategy returns ≠ expected trader wealth.

🛡️ Leakage-Safe Time Series Research Framework

Event-based walk-forward validation with purge & embargo

Prevents feature leakage and overlapping-label bias

Enforces strict train/test separation

Modular, reproducible research pipeline

Inspired by repeated real-world failures of naive CV

Guarantees:

No future data in features

Purged overlapping events

Optional embargo to reduce microstructure bleed

📉 Signal Robustness & Degradation Analysis

Why a signal can pass backtests and still be a bad idea

Sensitivity analysis across parameters

Noise, delay, and data corruption stress tests

Regime-based performance decomposition

Focus on smooth degradation and sign stability

This is not a strategy optimizer —
it is a diagnostic framework for signal survivability.
